Questions: 
1. Turtle analysis (gives a bunch of code but everything is weirded named, you have to provide what the varibles are or do)
2. File reading 
3. Monte Carlo (here's a game, simmulate it (involves a 6 sided dice))
4. List Processing

Actual question from a previous final:


text file named email_test.txt is:

Professor Rosen
Room 349
XXX-XX-XXXX
My email is tug85861@temple.edu or 
also andrew.rosen@temple.edu 
I am not rosen@temple.edu nor 
am I tun85861@temple.edu


Q: Remove all tuXXXXX@temple.edu emails by reading the file and then create a new file with this. 
A:
import re 

data = open("email_test.txt", "r")

output = open("email_output.txt", "w")

pattern = "tu[a-z]\d{5}@temple\.edu"                         #brackets mean choose one from any of these, the period or dot symbol is a wild card (could be anything) It needs a \.

for line in data:
    line = re.sub(pattern, "[REDACTED]", line)
    
    output.write(line)

output.close()
