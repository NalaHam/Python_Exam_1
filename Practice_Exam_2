1. (2 points) The string value “Howl’s Moving Castle” is a valid string. 
    Why isn’t it a problem that the single quote character in the word Howl’s isn’t escaped?
            Python recognizes that double quotes are using to define the string. 

2. (2 points) What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
          List shows a order of things. Dictionaries have keys and have other things associated with the key. 
          accessed the same way in python.

3. (3 points) If l is a list, what does the expression l[::-1] do?
         Everything in the list, starting from -1 (or the end)

4. (3 points) How can you slice notation to get the last 3 characters of a string?
         str[len(str)-3:]
         or
         str[-3:]

5. (2 points) How can you simulate a coin flip in python?
         import random
         random.randint[1,2] where heads is 1 and tails is 2
         or
         random.choice["H", "T"]

6. (3 points) I have a coin that is slightly weighted in favor of heads; 
it will land on heads 55% of the time. How would you simulate this in python using the random module?
         import random
         random.choice(["H"]*55+["T"]*45)
         or 
         if random.random() > 0.55: 
              print("Heads")
         else:
              print("Tails")


7. (20 points) From A Prior Exam Suppose we had a file called temperature.csv, which contains 
the daily high and low temperatures recorded in Philadelphia. The file is composed of three 
fields per a line, containing the date, the high temperature, and the low temperature. 
Each field is separated commas. For example, the contents of the file might look like this:
                          11/11/19, 64, 40 
                          11/12/19, 49, 21 
                          11/13/19, 33, 22 
                          ... ... ...

Write a program that calculates or prints the following:
5pts The day with the hottest high temperature. 
5pts The day with the coldest low temperature. 
10pts The average high temperature of the entire file.

          def readTemp(filename):
              data = open(filename, "r")
              hottestHot = -10000000
              hottestDay = ""
              coldestCold = 1000000
              coldestDay = ""
              allHighs = 0
              num_days = 0 
              for line in data:
                     fields = line.split(",") #[data, high,low]
                     high = int(fields[1])
                     low = int(fields[2])
                     if high > hottestHot:
                          hottestHot = high
                          hottestDay = fields[0]
                     if low < coldestCold:
                          coldestCold = low
                          coldestDay = fields[0]
                     
                     allHighs += high
                     num_days += 1
               print(hottestDay, coldestDay, allHighs/num_days)
           
          readTemp("temperature.csv")
      

8. (0 points) This question is extra practice.
Suppose you have a file named numbers.csv which contains a bunch of integers, 
five per line of text, separated by commas. Write code below that will open the file, 
read the numbers from it, and print the sum of all the even numbers in the file. 
For example, the file might look like this:
   353,213,5,12399421,1
   -4,3243,2323456,32186,4234
   123,1,2,3,4

    total = 0 
    for line in lines:            #looks like x,y,z,a,b 
        parts = line.split(",")   #makes a list ['x','y','z','a','b']
        for val in parts:
            if val % 2 == 0:
                total += int(val)
        
    return total

9. (10 points) unOrUn: If the given String begins with “un”, 
return a String with without the “un” in front. Otherwise, 
return the String with “un” added to the front of it. 
You may assume the String is at least 3 characters long.
# unOrUn("untied") -> "tied"
# unOrUn("unable") -> "able"
# unOrUn("necessary") -> "unnecessary" 

def unOrUn(word):
    if word[:2] == "un":
        return word[2:]
    else:
        return "un" + word
        

10. (10 points) maxMinDiff: Given an list of integers, 
return the difference between the maximum element and 
the minimum element. You may assume the list will have 2 or more elements in it.
# [1,2,3,4,5] -> 4
# [15,31,21,17,28] -> 16
# [-1,-100,12,2,100] -> 200 

def maxMinDiff(numbers):
    return max(numbers) - min(numbers)
    
or 

def maxMinDiff(numbers):
    biggest = number[0]
    smallest = number[0]
    
    for x in numbers:
        if x > biggest:
            biggest = x
        if x < smallest:
            smallest = x
    
    return biggest - smallest


11. (10 points) swapEnds: Given a list of numbers, 
modify the list such that the first and last elements are swapped. 
You may assume will have 2 or more elements in it.
# [1,2,3,4,5] -> [5,2,3,4,1]
# [15,31,21,17,28] -> [28,31,21,17,15]
# [-1,-100,12,2,100] -> [100,-100,12,2,-1] 

def swapEnds(numbers):
    end = numbers[-1] 
    start = numbers[0]
    numbers[0] = end
    numbers[-1] = start


12. (10 points) firstHalf: Given a list of things, return the first half of the list.
# [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [1,2,3]
# [15,31,21,17,28] -> [15,31]
# ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h"] -> ["a","b","c","d"] 

def firstHalf(theList):
    length = len(theList)//2
    return theList[:length]


13. (10 points) Write a method called hasWildcat: Given an input String word, 
return true if word contains the String “cat” in it, but the middle ‘a’ can be any char.
# hasWildcat("kitty") -> false
# hasWildcat("tomcat") -> true
# hasWildcat("c4tn1P") -> true

def hasWildcat(word): # A-- would not buy again
  for i in range(0,len(word)-2):
      if word[i] == "c" and word[i+2] == "t":
          return True
  return False


14. (0 points) Extra Practice We’ll say that a value is “everywhere” in 
an array if for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one 
of the pair is that value. Return true if the given value is everywhere in the array.

# isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) -> true
# isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) -> false

    for i in range(0, leng(nums)-1):
        if val not in nums[i:i+2]:
            return False
    return True


15. (10 points) Given a string, return the sum of the digits 0-9
that appear in the string, ignoring all other characters. 
Return 0 if there are no digits in the string. 
(Note: s.isdigit() tests if a the string s is one of the characters ’0’, ’1’, ... ’9’. )
# http://codingbat.com/prob/p197890 
# sumStringDigits("aa1bc2d3") -> 6 
# sumStringDigits("aa11b33") -> 8
# sumStringDigits("Chocolate") -> 0

    for chr in word: 
        if chr.isdigit():
            total = total + int(chr)
     
    return total
    
    

16. (5 points) Given an integer, return the sum of the digits 0-9 of that integer.
# sumDigits(1234) -> 10 
# sumDigits(1000) -> 1 
# sumDigits(-581) -> 14 

def sumDigits(num):
    total = 0 
    
    while num >0:
        lastDigit = num % 10
        total += lastDigit
        num = num // 10    #removes lastDigit
    return total


17. (0 points) Extra Practice Given a list of positive numbers, 
return a new list of length “count” containing the first even numbers 
from the original array. The original list will contain at least “count” even numbers.

Write a program that computes the average closing price (the second column, labeled SP500) and the highest long-term interest rate. 
Both should be computed only for the period from June 2016 through May 2017. Save the results in the variables mean_SP and max_interest.
